✭ MAGNETRON ™ ✭: Implementation of Google's Dreambooth (with Stable Diffusion model) instead of IMAGEN (for making MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY IMAGINATION PROXIA). In particular this can be used to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts.

[*] DEPENDENCIES: INCLUDED

This PROXIA will have the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. Given as input just a few images of a subject, you can fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion in this case, although this method is not limited to a specific model) such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. In other words the ROBOT will be able to IMAGINE/Generate photorealistic IMAGES of the same subjet in different contexts/scenes for better understanding.

EXAMPLE USAGE:

e.g On an ASTRAL MINDCLOUD this PROXIA can be used to process INFORMATION sent to it from an INSTINCTIVE MIND PROXIA/MINDCLOUD (OBJECT DETECTION). So for example if the ROBOT or a SWARM/HIVE/PHALANX of ROBOTS encounters an intersting object they can use their eye cameras to IMAGES of the subject which can be used as INPUT for this IMAGINATION PROXIA. Novel views of the subject in different scenes/environments can be generated from text prompts. This can help ROBOTS better understand the subject of the IMAGE (as well as how humans view it). [SEE EXAMPLE IMAGES]

e.g DREAMING: IMAGINATION PROXIAS CAN BE USED BY THE ROBOTS TO "DREAM". BY DREAMING I MEAN WHEN THE ROBOT IS IN HIBERNATION/SLEEP MODE IT CAN STILL PROCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON A LIMITED BASIS FROM PERIODIC TEXT PROMPTS (e.g from news, police reports).
